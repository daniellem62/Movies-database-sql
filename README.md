## Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
- **PostgreSQL**: You need a running PostgreSQL instance for the project.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up the database connection by configuring the `index.js` file with your PostgreSQL credentials.
4. Run the `resetDatabase` script to create and populate the database:
    ```bash
    npm run reset-database
    ```
    This function will drop existing tables if they exist, create new tables, and insert sample data.

## Extra Features


#### 1. **Fetch Movies by Director's Name (Join)**

Instead of querying movies using the director's ID, you can now fetch movies based on the **director's name**. This makes it easier for users to find movies from a specific director without needing to know the ID.

**Example Request:**

`GET /directors/filter?last_name=Miyazaki`

This request will return all movies directed by **Hayao Miyazaki**.

#### 2. **Fetch a Director's Highest Revenue Movie (Join)**

The API also supports fetching the **highest revenue movie** for each director by joining the **movies**, **directors**, and **accolades** tables. This is a useful feature for those who want to quickly know which movie of a director has made the most revenue.

**Example Request:**

`GET /directors/revenue?last_name=Miyazaki`

This request will return the highest revenue movie directed by **Hayao Miyazaki** based on the data from the **movies** and **accolades** tables.

### Example SQL Query

For those interested in how the highest-grossing movie for a director is retrieved, here's the SQL query that joins the three tables:

```sql
(SELECT name, revenue, first_name, last_name
FROM movies
JOIN directors ON directors.id = movies.director_id
JOIN accolades ON accolades.movies_id = movies.id
WHERE directors.last_name = $1
ORDER BY accolades.revenue
DESC LIMIT 1", [last_name])
```
